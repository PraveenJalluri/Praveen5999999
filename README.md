Hi, I’m Praveen
I’m interested in full-stack development, test automation, and exploring AI/ML applications
I’m currently learning React.js, Node.js, Django, Selenium/Playwright, and ongoing trainings in NVIDIA Robotics (Isaac) & Oracle ML algorithms trying out KAGGLE too!
I’m looking to collaborate on web applications, open-source automation projects, and beginner-friendly AI/ML experiments
